# SDE MobileServer

`🇸-🇩-🇪📱️🌐️💾️ SDE MobileServer is an experimental project chain with the goal of running an entire server off of a portable device (phones, phablets, and tablets)`

## Project goal

This project has 2 goals:

- To see if it is possible to run an entire server off of a mobile device
- To raise the default storage capacity in mobile devices to accomodate mobile servers (this can be done if the project is successful enough to create a demand for higher-capacity phones and tablets to run larger servers)

This project was made part of the SDE project, as I couldn't fit it in anywhere else, nor make it a separate project.

## Original draft

### Imager

The imager is a way to image the server and its data from a desktop computer to a mobile device. Since phones can't be used to program large applications, the imager is a very important component.

### Test zone

The test zone is a set of sandbox servers and tools to test the server on your mobile device before deployment. It contains some basic webpages, along with the 3 acid tests (with some other standards checks) to test how devices display server webpages.

### Connection types:

- Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz (limited server)
- Wi-Fi 5.0 Ghz (basic server)
- 1x mobile data (inapplicable) ❌️
- 2G mobile data (the most basic server)
- 3G mobile data (very limited server)
- 4G mobile data (limited server)
- 5G mobile data (be careful about billing)
- 6G mobile data (be careful about billing)
- Mobile hotspot 2.4 Ghz (limited server)
- Mobile hotspot 5.0 Ghz (basic server)
- Bluetooth (limited server)

### Languages

SDE MobileServer is written in:

- Java (Android)
- Kotlin (FireOS)
- Swift (iOS)
- Objective-C++ (iPadOS)
- Python, Vala (Ubuntu, PostMarketOS)
- C (Core)
